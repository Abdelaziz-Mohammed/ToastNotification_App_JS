# ToastNotification_App_JS
HTML, CSS, and JS ToastNotification_App_JS at my learning journey. The ninth project from 30_Days_With_30_Projects learning journey.

## Toast Notification App
This project is a Toast Notification Application that allows users to trigger different types of notifications 
(Success, Error, Warning, and Info) by clicking on corresponding buttons. 
The notifications are displayed dynamically and disappear after a few seconds or can be dismissed manually.

## Features
- Four types of toast notifications: Success, Error, Warning, and Info.
- Animations for toast appearance and disappearance.
- Auto-dismissal of notifications after a set time.
- Manual dismissal of notifications using the exit button.
- Dynamic message and icon updates based on the notification type.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the main app structure.
- **CSS**: For styling the toast notifications and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: For handling toast creation, dynamic updates, and animations.
- **Font Awesome**: For displaying icons for each toast type.

## How to Use
1. Open the app.
2. Click on any of the buttons (`Success`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`) to trigger the corresponding toast notification.
3. The toast will appear at the top-right of the screen and will automatically disappear after 4.5 seconds.
4. Alternatively, you can close the notification manually by clicking the exit button (X).
